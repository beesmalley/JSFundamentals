//for loops are as expected when compared to java
for(let i=0;i<10;i++){
    console.log(i)
}//prints 0-9

//while loops also work as expected
// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
for (let counterOne = 1; counterOne < 4; counterOne++){
    console.log(counterOne);
  }
   
  // A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
  let counterTwo = 1;
  while (counterTwo < 4) {
    console.log(counterTwo);
    counterTwo++;
  }
  
//and same for do-while loops
